        <p>On many of the pages of the site you will see &#39;social buttons&#39;. These enable users to share or
            bookmark the web pages. In order to implement these buttons, and connect them to the relevant social
            networks and external sites, there are scripts from domains outside. You should be aware that these
            sites are likely to be collecting information about what you are doing all around the internet. So if
            you click on any of these buttons, these sites will be registering that action and may use that

            the specific pages you are on, even if you don&#39;t click on the button if you are logged into their
            services, like Google and Facebook. You should check the respective policies of each of these sites to

            social buttons we cannot prevent these sites, or external domains, from collecting information on your
            usage of this embedded content. If you are not logged in to these external services then they will not
            know who you are but are likely to gather anonymous usage information e.g. number of views, plays, loads
            etc.</p>
