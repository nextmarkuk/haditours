            <p><strong>7. DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY&nbsp;</strong><br />
                (a) Except as may be set out in these terms of use, this site, its content, and any use you choose to
                make of it, are provided and permitted without any representations or warranties of any kind, whether
                express or implied, and we disclaim all such representations and warranties so far as permitted by law.
                We do not warrant that information contained on or accessed through this site is adequate, complete,
                accurate or up-to-date, nor do we warrant that the site (or any part of it) will always be accessible,
                fully functional or free from errors and viruses. Accordingly, you agree that the only remedy available
                to you for breach of these terms of use shall be for our breach of contract under these terms of
                use.<br />
                (b) Subject to paragraph (d) below, but otherwise so far as permitted by law, we exclude and are not
                liable for all loss, damage(s) and liability (whether or not caused by our negligence) for all wasted
                time, all loss/corruption of data, all loss of profits, opportunities, and goodwill, and all indirect,
                consequential and punitive loss or damage(s) arising from or in relation to use of this site and/or the
                information on it or any services provided through it, howsoever arising, whether in contract, tort
                (including negligence), statute or otherwise, and even if it was reasonably foreseeable or we have been
                made aware of the possibility of such loss/damage(s)/liability.<br />
                (c) Subject to paragraph (d) below, but otherwise so far as permitted by law, our total aggregate
                liability hereunder in respect of direct loss and damage and other direct liability, howsoever arising,
                whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute or otherwise shall be limited per claim or
                series of related claims, to &pound;100.<br />
                (d) Nothing in these terms of use shall limit our liability for:&nbsp;<br />
                (i) loss or damage for death or personal injury caused by our negligence; or<br />
                (ii) for any fraudulent misrepresentation made by us or those under our control.<br />

                your statutory rights.</p>

            <p><strong>8. SEVERABILITY</strong>: If one or more of the provisions of these terms of use are at any time
                found to be invalid by a court, tribunal or other forum of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise rendered
                unenforceable, that decision shall not invalidate or void the remainder of these terms of use. These
                terms of use shall be deemed amended by modifying or severing such provisions as necessary to render
                them valid, legal and enforceable while preserving their intent, or if that is not possible, by
                substituting another provision that is valid, legal and enforceable which materially gives effect to
                their intent. Any invalid or unenforceable provision or provisions shall be severable from these terms
                of use so that the validity or enforceability of their remaining provisions, or the validity of the
                provision(s) in question in any other jurisdiction shall not be affected.</p>

            <p><strong>9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT:</strong> These terms of use supersede all prior agreements, arrangements and
                statements (except for those for which liability is not excluded) between us with respect to your use of
                this site and constitute the entire agreement between us relating to the same.</p>

            <p><strong>10. CHANGE OF TERMS OF USE:</strong> We may alter, adapt or otherwise change these terms of use

                you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those
                circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money

                scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees
                any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services,
                including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also
                agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have
                claimed under the ATOL scheme.</p>
